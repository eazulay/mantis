Customisations of MantisBT for Get IT Write International

I use this repository to publish code changes to our company's version of MantisBT. They are based on MantisBT version 1.2.

You can find the original version here: https://www.mantisbt.org

If you use MantisBT you may find it useful to look at my commits to get an idea of the features I've added and how to implement them.
